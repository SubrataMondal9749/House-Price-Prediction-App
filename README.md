# 🏠 Price Prediction App

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, age, and distance from the city.  
Built as part of my learning journey in Data Science and deployed using Streamlit.

---

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates the **complete machine learning workflow** — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model building and web app deployment.  
Users can enter property details and instantly get a predicted price.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit
- Pickle (for model serialization)

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source Custom / Open dataset (e.g., Kaggle)
- Size : 10,000 records  
- Features : Square footage, number of rooms, house age, distance to city, Price  
- Target Variable : Price (in USD)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. *Data Preprocessing – handled missing values, outliers, and scaled numerical columns  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  – used correlation heatmaps and distribution plots  
3. Model Building – Linear Regression (tested with other regressors)  
4. Model Evaluation– used metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R² Score  
5. Model Deployment – built interactive Streamlit app for predictions
